# Financial-Inclusion-Project
Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. My role as a Data Scientist is to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account and provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individuals’ financial outcomes.  The Null hypothesis is that 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania) have access to a bank account.

## Metrics For Success

1.   To provide some key demographic factors that may drive individuals’ financial outcomes
2.   To provide indicators of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.
3. To identify which individuals are more likely to open a bank account

## Experimental Design
To define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the Data Analytic Question
To find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
To perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.
To implement the solution by performing factor analysis, principal component analysis, and discriminant analysis.
To challenge my solution by providing insights on how improvements can be made.
